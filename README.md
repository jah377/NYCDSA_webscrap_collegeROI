# NYCDSA_webscrap_collegeROI
College selection is an exciting, yet anxiety-inducing, process for high school seniors and parents alike. While higher education was seen as a period for self-exploration and expanding one's mind, ever-increasing tuition costs have forced a sense of pragmatism - emphasizing university as an investment. Growing up in Texas, I attended Texas Tech University as most students apply to public universities due to the strength of the state institutions. Moving to Philadelphia to attend Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania exposed me to emphasis placed on private and Ivy League education in the North-East corridor. **This experience begs the question: What is the expected return on investment of higher education? Is there a difference between public and private universities, and is this different regional? What majors yield the highest return?** Using a dataset obtained from a website using a custom-written Selenium web scraper, the current project submited as part of the NYC Data Science Academy (2020 cohort) aimed to explore the relationships between levels of education, type of education, major, and region, and estimated 20 year ROI. The results of the present study found that the benefits of a private school education may be limited to the North East, and noted differences between public and private school ROI when broke down by major. This information may be vital as students and families plan for the future.
